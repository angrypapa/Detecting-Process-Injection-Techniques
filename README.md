# Detecting Process Injection Techniques:
This is a repository that is meant to hold detections for various process injection techniques.

# General Information: 

* Data analytics written within Jupyter Notebooks can be found within the `Detection_Notebooks` folder. 

* Detection write-ups of each technique can be found within the `Detection_WriteUps` folder.

* Datasets of each technique can be found here: [Process Injection Datasets](https://github.com/jsecurity101/mordor/tree/master/small_datasets/windows/defense_evasion/process_injection_T1055)

## Technqiues Covered Within This Project:
* DLL Injection
* Reflective DLL Injection
* Process Hollowing
* Process Reimaging (Not necessarily injection, but still useful)
