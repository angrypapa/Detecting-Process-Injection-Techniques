# Detecting Process Injection Techniques:
This is a repository that is meant to hold detections for various process injection techniques.

# General Information: 

* Data analytics written within Jupyter Notebooks can be found within the `Detection_Notebooks` folder. 

* Datasets of each technique can be found within the respective folders. 

## Technqiues Covered Within This Project:
* DLL Injection
* Reflective DLL Injection
* Process Hollowing
* Process Reimaging (not necessarily injection, but still useful)
* Hook Injection via SetWindowsHookEx
